<h5><b>The tau lepton</b></h5>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/info/tau.png" alt="A plot from the original publication" align="right">
The tau is an elementary particle similar to the electron, with negative electric charge and a spin of 1/2. Together with the electron, the muon, and the three neutrinos, it is classified as a lepton. Despite of the meaning of the word lepton (fine, small, thin) the tau is very massive: it has mass of 1776.82 MeV/c^2 (for comparison: the mass of the electron is 0.511 MeV/c^2, the mass of the proton is 938.27 MeV/c^2).

<h5><b>The discovery of the tau</b></h5>
<p>
The tau was detected in a series of experiments between 1974 and 1977 by Martin Lewis Perl with his colleagues at the SLAC-LBL group. Their equipment consisted of SLAC's then-new e+–e− colliding ring, called SPEAR, and the LBL magnetic detector. They could detect and distinguish between leptons, hadrons and photons.<br>
Martin Perl shared the 1995 Nobel Prize in Physics with Frederick Reines. The latter was awarded his share of the prize for experimental discovery of the neutrino.
